Title: GG GENERAL STORE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Intro:
General store is a type of store that sells basic necessities like food, currenttime essentials such as mask and hand sanitizer, toiletries and much more. So, this type of store needs a lot more of manpower to support the operations of this type of store such as being a cashier, arrange inventory, deal with suppliers and counting the revenue generated for the day.However, GG general store does not have that luxury of manpower since the store is run by one person. So, the ownerâ€™s workload for his store is pretty huge. This system designed to reduce some ofhis workload to record the inventory record and the revenue record. Before the implementation of this system, the owner faces problem such as messy inventory record, inaccurate revenue record, hard to guess revenue from current inventory batch and inventory/revenue record is too vulnerable that increase the probability of the record being stole or hijacked by third parties that have access to the physical record. This system aims to create organized inventory record, automate revenue record, create profit/loss report and increase the security to access the records.
